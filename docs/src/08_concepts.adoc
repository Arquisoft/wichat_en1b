== Cross-cutting Concepts


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]

.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules
All the documentation added is purely introductory, it doesn't represent final decisions as the aplication isn't developed yet.

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

| *Class* | *Explanation*
| Question | The model of the questions stores both right and wrong answers.
| User | The people using the application, they have statistics and take part in a ranking to compete.
| Answer | Models each possible answer, created to reuse answers that are common to different questions, as well as distractors.
| Game | It is created when the user starts a game and includes the rounds that the user has to answer.
| Statistics | Stores information about the amount of correct and wrong answers that each user has answered.
| QuestionCategory | Category for the question
| AnswerCategory | Category of the answer (used for getting distractors)

===Architecture and design patterns:

===Safety and Security concepts:
Passwords must be hashed both in client and in API to ensure as much security as possible.An example to do it could be using SpringBoot3

===Development concepts:

===User Experience:
As this is a game, the focus must be in our users so players can have a good experience, for achieving this, the response time should be less than 1,5 seconds and the interfaces should be intuitive and easy to learn.

===Robustness:
It is desired to make the application as independant as possible from Wikidata. This way, if Wikidata is down our application can still manage to be available for our users.

===Under-the-hood:

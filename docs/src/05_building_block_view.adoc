== Building Block View

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image::05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/[Building Block View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Whitebox Overall System

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

Motivation::
In this level we represent the general overview of the system from a high level point of view. This level represents the general idea in which the application is based.

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.

==== WIChat

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe <black box 1>
according the the following black box template:

* Purpose/Responsibility
* Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs. This interfaces may include qualities and performance characteristics.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box, e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....
* (Optional) directory/file location
* (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to requirements).
* (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

===== Responsibility
Represents the whole system. It is in charge of managing the different modules that compose the application, as well as communicating with the LLM provider and Wikidata.

===== Interfaces
* **Wikidata**: Retrieve questions and answers.
* **LLM Provider**: Retrieve hints for the user.

==== Wikidata
This interface represents the Wikidata service that is in charge of providing the necessary information to create the questions that the user will have to answer. They should also provide the answers to the questions that the user will have to answer.

==== LLM Provider
This interface represents the provider of the LLM who the application communicates with to obtain the hints required by the user in order to answer the questions.

=== Level 2

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system

Motivation::
In this level we represent the inner structure of the WIChat module. This level represents a communication between several parts of the application by means of a gateway.

==== WebApp

===== Responsibility
Represents the interacting point of the application. It contains the different modules that conform the application front-end. It is in charge of managing the user interaction.

===== Interfaces
* **Gateway Service**: Communicate with the back-end.

==== WIChat Services

===== Responsibility
Represents the services that the WIChat module provides. It represents the back-end of the application.

===== Interfaces
* **Gateway Service**: Communicate with the front- with back-end.
* **LLM Provider**: Retrieve hints for the user.
* **Wikidata**: Retrieve questions and answers.

==== Gateway Service
This interface represents the accessing point where all services are joined together. It allows an easy communication between the different modules of the application and provides useful methods to fulfill that end.

=== Level 3

image::05_building_blocks-EN_3.png["Building block level 3"]

Motivation::
In this level we represent the inner structure of the front and back-end modules of the application. This level illustrates the different responsibilities of the modules that are encountered at the lowest level of the application.

==== Home
Represents the main page. It allows users to either log in or sign up.

===== Interfaces
* **Gateway Service**: Display application status information.

==== New User
Represents the page where users can sign up.

===== Interfaces
* **Gateway Service**: Save the registration data in the database.

==== Log In
Represents the page where users can log in.

===== Interfaces
* **Gateway Service**: Authentication purposes.

==== User menu
Represents the menu that users can access once they have logged in or created an account.

==== Statistics
Represents the page where users can see their statistics.

===== Interfaces
* **Gateway Service**: Obtain those statistics.

==== Game
Represents the page where users can play the game.

===== Interfaces
* **Gateway Service**: Questions and hints.

==== Auth Service
Represents the authentication service where users will log into their accounts.

===== Interfaces
* **Gateway Service**: Send the login status of the user that tried to log in.
* **Database**: Retrieve the user information to check if the user information is valid.

==== User Service
Represents the service where users will manage their account creations.

* **Gateway Service**: Accept the user account creation information.
* **Database**: Insert the retrieved information for their persistance.

==== Statistics Service
Represents the service where statistics from users will be retrieved.

===== Interfaces
* **Gateway Service**: Send those statistics to be displayed in the application.
* **Database**: Store the statistics needed for the application to work.

==== Question Service
It is in charge of managing the creation of questions and answers.

* **Gateway Service**: Sharing the question and possible answers to the user.
* **Database**: Store the questions that might be needed for the application to work.

==== LLM Service
It represents the service that will provide the hints to the users by means of an LLM.

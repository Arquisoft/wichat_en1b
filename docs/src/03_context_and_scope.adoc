== Context and Scope

This section defines the boundaries of the **WIChat** application, its communication partners, and the technologies used to interact with them. The system is designed to provide an interactive quiz experience, leveraging **Wikidata** for question generation and an **Empathy API** for LLM-based hints.

=== Business Context

The WIChat application interacts with the following communication partners:

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Communication Partner | Inputs | Outputs
| User | Answers to quiz questions, requests for hints | Quiz questions, hints, feedback (correct/incorrect answers)
| Wikidata (via MediaWiki Action API) | Requests for question data (e.g., images, correct answers, distractors) | Question data (e.g., images, correct answers, distractors)
| Empathy API | Requests for hints based on question data | Generated hints for quiz questions
|===

**Explanation of External Domain Interfaces**:
 
- **Users**: Interact with the system via a web frontend, answering questions and requesting hints.
- **Wikidata**: Provides structured data for generating quiz questions and answers.
- **Empathy API**: Generates conversational hints for users based on the question data.

=== Technical Context

The technical interfaces and communication channels for the WIChat application are as follows:

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Communication Partner | Channel/Protocol | Input/Output Mapping
| User | HTTP/HTTPS (Web Browser) | User interactions (answers, hint requests) and system responses (questions, hints)
| Wikidata | HTTP/HTTPS (MediaWiki Action API) | API requests for question data and API responses with structured data
| Empathy API | HTTP/HTTPS (REST API) | API requests for hints and API responses with generated hints
|===

**Explanation of Technical Interfaces**:

- **Frontend**: Built with **React**, communicates with the backend via HTTP/HTTPS.
- **Backend**: Built with **NodeJS + Express**, handles API requests to Wikidata and Empathy, and manages user data in **MongoDB**.
- **Database**: **MongoDB** stores user data, including historical performance and game statistics.
- **LLM Integration**: **Empathy API** is used for generating hints.

**Mapping Input/Output to Channels**:

- User inputs (answers, hint requests) are sent via HTTP/HTTPS to the backend.
- The backend sends API requests to Wikidata and Empathy, and processes their responses.
- The backend sends quiz questions, hints, and feedback to the user via HTTP/HTTPS.

=== System Scope

The WIChat application includes the following components:

1. **Frontend**: A React-based web application for user interaction.
2. **Backend**: A NodeJS + Express server for handling business logic and API integrations.
3. **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data and game statistics.
4. **External APIs**:
   - **Wikidata**: For generating quiz questions and answers.
   - **Empathy API**: For generating conversational hints.

The system does **not** include:

- Development of the LLM (Empathy) itself.
- Hosting or maintenance of Wikidata.

=== Team Context

The project is being developed by a team of 5 students with the following responsibilities:

1. **Frontend Development**: Implementation of the React-based user interface.
2. **Backend Development**: Implementation of the NodeJS + Express server and API integrations.
3. **Database Management**: Design and maintenance of the MongoDB database.
4. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Ensuring the system meets functional and non-functional requirements.
5. **Documentation and Deployment**: Compiling documentation using AsciiDoc and PlantUML, and deploying the application to GitHub Pages.

=== Summary

The WIChat application is a web-based quiz system that integrates with **Wikidata** for question generation and **Empathy API** for hint generation. The system is built using modern web technologies (React, NodeJS, MongoDB) and follows the **Arc42** template for documentation. 
Our team is responsible for all aspects of development, testing, and deployment.

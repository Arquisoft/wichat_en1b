== Architecture Decisions

[cols="1,3,2,2", options="header"]
|===
| ID | Decision | Rationale | Impacted Quality Attributes

| AD-001
| React with JavaScript frontend
| Eliminates the overhead of type annotations and compilation; simplifies setup and iteration
| Maintainability, Usability, Flexibility

| AD-002
| Node.js/Express backend
| Unified JavaScript stack enables code reuse; event-driven architecture supports concurrent users
| Performance Efficiency

| AD-003
| MongoDB Atlas (free tier)
| Schema flexibility for evolving game stats; managed service reduces DevOps overhead
| Reliability, Portability

| AD-004
| Empathy API + Wikidata validation layer
| Balances LLM cost vs accuracy; validation prevents hallucinations
| Reliability, Functional Suitability

| AD-005
| JWT authentication
| Faster implementation than OAuth; sufficient for MVP security needs
| Security

| AD-006
| Server-Sent Events (SSE)
| Lightweight real-time updates without WebSocket complexity
| Performance Efficiency

| AD-007
| Progressive Web App strategy
| Single codebase for web/mobile; offline-first capabilities
| Portability
